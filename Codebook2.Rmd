In the first step, the coades loads the dplyr packages which is necessary to performe the analyses.

In the second step, the code loades the three datasets within the train and test data sets.

In the third and fourth steps, the codes merge three datasets within the train and test datasets creating train and test datas.

In the fifth step the code merge data and train datasets creating the final merged data.

In the sixth step, using the variables names files, the code assigns the suitable name to each variable.

In the seventh stage, variables that reported mean and SD are extracted.

In the eights stage, the six factors of avitivities are created within the variable.

In the ninth stage, abbreviations within the variables names are replaced with the original names.

In the last stage, the data was grouped by type of activity and subjects and mean of each variable for each group was calculated.
